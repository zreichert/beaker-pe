# At this point, acceptance testing of beaker-pe has been left in beaker itself,
# since that requires no work at this point since beaker includes this.
# TODO note that when things change for Beaker 3.0, testing will have to be
#   changed to match a different pattern, where the `install_pe` acceptance
#   testing will all be done in this library's testing.
