# This is commented out because Beaker is going to include this
# library itself until version 3.0.
# # Boilerplate DSL inclusion mechanism:
# # First we register our module with the Beaker DSL
# Beaker::DSL.register( Beaker::DSL::PE )
# # Then we have to re-include our amended DSL in the TestCase,
# # because in general, the DSL is included in TestCase far
# # before test files are executed, so our amendments wouldn't
# # come through otherwise
# include Beaker::DSL
