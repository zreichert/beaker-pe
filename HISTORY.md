PE-19086 Change extend gpg key to ignore gpg key warnings (#47)

The extended GPG-key for PE 2015.2 -> 2016.1.2 has expired.
Rather then continue to update it every few months, lets just
enable the older versions of PE that are installed on debian
systems to ignore gpg-key warnings.
We will still have testing coverage of the gpg-key on debian
systems via fresh installs of PE and testing upgrades from
PE 2016.2.0 and newer.

(PE-18728) Skip frictionless install if agent is affected by powershell 2 bug (#45)

We introduced frictionless installs for Windows agents in PE 2016.4.0.
For upgrade scenarios where we are testing frictionless upgrades, to
install we need to use the old MSI method if we are installing less then
PE 2016.4.0.
However, we have discovered that frictionless installs of windows2008r2
will fail on PE 2016.4.0 and PE 2016.4.2.
This PR adds in logic to install with the non-frictionless method if the
agent is windows2008r2 and version is less then PE 2016.4.3.

(PE-18516,PE-18170) Temporarily set pe.conf when upgrading to Flanders

At the moment, MEEP does not create a 2.0 pe.conf when recovering
configuration for an upgrade.  This is preventing all upgrade tests from
PE >= 2016.2 (when meep was introduced) to PE >= 2017.1 from completing
because meep ends up using a 1.0 pe.conf that has no node_roles. Without
the node_roles information, the node is not considered infrastructure,
and meep's enc returns no classes for it, so nothing happens in the
upgrade apply.

This is not currently a problem upgrading from < 2016.2 because
beaker-pe is providing the beaker-answers pe.conf in those cases.

To work around this, I've added a check, just if we are upgrading to a
Flanders version, which supplies the beaker-answers generated pe.conf.

This patch is just intended to get upgrades from earlier meep versions
working in CI. When we get to PE-18170 (also scheduled for Flanders)
we'll work on improving recover configuration to generate a 2.0 pe.conf,
with the goal being that beaker-answers should not need to provide
anything for pe.conf for Flanders upgrades unless some additional
parameters were added in the beaker configuration.

Prior to this PR, the PE the do_higgs_install method waits for the below PE installation log:
"Please go to https://higgs_installer_web_server:3000 in your browser to continue installation"

However, newer PE, for example in Davis builds, that line of log has changed to be:
"#Go to  https://higgs_installer_web_server:3000 in your browser to continue installation"

In BKR-908, code was added to make console timeout checking
configurable. This code relied on `@options` to get the
value from the global option. This works in beaker but not
in beaker-rspec, because `@options` is a TestCase instance
variable. The accessor `options` works in both, because it
is a TestCase accessor in beaker, and a similar method has
been added in beaker-rspec's [shim](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker-rspec/blob/master/lib/beaker-rspec/beaker_shim.rb#L26-L28).

* (maint) Add install helpers for pe-client-tools

This commit adds three helper methods to install pe-client-tools on Windows.

The first is a general  method that is designed to abstract
away the installation of pe-client-tools on supported operating systems.
Currently, it only accommodates development builds of the tools based on the
provided SHA and SUITE_VERSION environment variables available.

The second is a generic method to install an msi package on a target host.
Beaker's built in method of this name assumes that msi installed involves the
installation of puppet, so this method overrides that one without such an
assumption.

The this is a generic method to install a dmg package on a target host.
Beaker's built in `install_package` method for osx does not accommodate for an
installer `pkg` file that is named differently from the containing `dmg`. This
method forces the user to supply both names explicitly.

* (maint) Remove install helpers for pe-client-tools

This commit removes the dmg and msi helper methods instroduced earlier.

These two methods have bee moved into beaker.

Before this commit the console may or may not be functional by the time

puppetserver to return with an error from the classifier when it is
attempting to evaluate the classes which should be applied to the node.

This commit adds in a sleep and service check to the final agent run
step on the console node which will hopefully work around this issue
until it is fixed in SERVER-1237.

Prior to this commit the condition used to decide whether to use
the `-c`/`-f` flags was dependent on `host['pe_upgrade_ver']` and
`host['pe_ver']` which was an unreliable condition.
This commit updates the condition to determine whether to use the
`-f` flag to simply look at `host['pe_ver']` because that value
is updated depending on what version of pe is currently being
installed or upgraded to.
The condition to decide to omit the `-c` flag has to depend on
`opts[:HOSTS][host.name][:pe_ver]` because that value is not
modified during upgrade and can be used for a valid comparison
to determine if the install will have a `pe.conf` file to use
for an upgrade.

(PE-15351) Use -f option for 2016.2.1+ installs

Prior to this commit there was not an option for signalling a
non-interactive install to the installer.
This commit adds the new `-f` option added in
https://github.com/puppetlabs/pe-installer-shim/pull/31 to the
command line options for installation/upgrade.

Additionally, this commit will remove the `-c` parameter being
passed on upgrades from a 2016.2.0+ install, because the installer
should be able to pick up on the existing pe.conf file.

(PE-16566) Add method to download life support gpg key

As of July 8th, 2016 the GPG key that was shipped with and used to sign
repos inside of PE tarballs expired. A new life support key was created
that extended the expiration date to Jan 2017. That key shipped with PE
3.8.5 and 2016.1.2.

apt based platforms appear to be the only package manager failing due to
an expired key, while rpm is fine.

This commit adds a new helper method to additionally download and
install the extended key for PE versions that have already been released
and are needing to be tested.

(PE-14555) Always use MEEP for >= 2016.2.0

Prior to this commit pe-beaker would use `INSTALLER_TYPE` to
specify whether to run a MEEP (new) or legacy install.
This commit changes pe-beaker to always use MEEP if the PE
version being installed is >= 2016.2.0, and legacy otherwise.

No ENV parameters will be passed to specify which to use, as we
are now relying on the installer itself to default to using MEEP
by default in all 2016.2.0 builds going forward.

necessary if we are upgrading from an older pe that beaker just
installed using the legacy script/answer defaults.

Also logs the actual answers/pe.conf file that was generated so we can

(maint) Make the previous_pe_ver available on upgrade

Sometimes during PE upgrades we need to be able to determine what

upgrade.  Prior to this change, that could only be determined by probing
into the original host.cfg yaml. This patch just sets it explicitly in
each host prior to overwriting the pe_ver with pe_upgrade_ver.

longer have to have both installer scripts operational in the same

Each change to do_install and supporting methods involving a

version_is_less's behavior.  This is unnecessary given that hosts are
being set with a version, and actually masks behavior of the class.
Removing these specifically because it was causing churn when
introducing meep functionality.

(PE-14934) Fix specs to cover changes from PE-14934

Introduced chagnes to the do_install method, but specs were failing
because of the tight coupling between expectations and counts of command
execution.

The need to initialize metadata comes from the fact that the previous
PR #3 added step() calls, which reference the TestCase metadata attr.
Since we aren't using an actual TestCase instance, this had to be
initalized separately.

Fixes windows masterless installation

Setting up a masterless windows client would fail with the following error:

Exited: 1
/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/beaker-2.37.0/lib/beaker/host.rb:330:in `exec': Host 'sxrwjhkia9gzo03' exited with 1 running: (Beaker::Host::CommandFailure)
 cmd.exe /c puppet config set server
Last 10 lines of output were:
        Error: puppet config set takes 2 arguments, but you gave 1
        Error: Try 'puppet help config set' for usage

As far as I could see this error is caused by the 'setup_defaults_and_config_helper_on' function which tries to set the master configuration setting in puppet.conf. But since there is no master varaible available this failes.

This patch should fix that by only calling setup_defaults_and_config_helper_on whern we're not doing a masterless installation.
